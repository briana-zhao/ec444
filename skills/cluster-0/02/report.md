## Summary

I set up my personal GitHub account (username: zhaobri), and I installed git and GitHub Desktop onto my computer. I also created an individual repository on the EC444 GitHub (repository: Zhao-Briana). I've added a screenshot of me commiting and pushing this report.md file to my repository in the 'images' directory. 

Our team created a group GitHub repository (TeamRockBison-Yoon-Zhao), which I've cloned to my local computer.
