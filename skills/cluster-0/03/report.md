## Summary
I created a new post in the Quest 0 discussion page on Blackboard about myself and consenting to class recordings. 
I also created a Team in 'Groups' on Blackboard with current members of our team. We're still looking for one more team member, so we'll update the team when we find one more person. 

Update: Shineun Yoon and I are a group of 2.
