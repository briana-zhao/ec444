## Summary

For this skill I used the provided ESP32 WiFi Station example to connect my ESP32 to my home router. After building and flashing the example, I was able to connect the ESP32 to the router, and it was assigned an IP address.


## Sketches and Photos

Here is an image of the device list for my router. The ESP32 is connected as 'espressif':
