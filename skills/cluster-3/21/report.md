## Summary

For this skill, I installed multiple softwares onto the Raspberry Pi Zero to enable the webcam. I was able to test taking photos with the camera, and I also used the 'motion' software to stream video from the webcam onto a webserver. 


## Sketches and Photos

Here is an image I took with the webcam:
