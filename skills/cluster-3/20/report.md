#  Dynamic DNS

## Summary
For this skill I enabled Dynamic DNS by creating an account through No-IP. I connected my router to the DDNS service then used DDNS to allow the host name/link brianaec444.mynetgear.com to take the place of an IP address. I also needed to set up port-forwarding to allow the DDNS url to access a webserver from an IP address with any device that is connected to any network. To demonstrate this, I brought up a webserver on my laptop and accessed the page with the DDNS link from multiple devices and networks.


## Sketches and Photos
