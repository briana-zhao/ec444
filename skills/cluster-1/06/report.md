## Summary

For this skill, I learned how to communicate between my PC and my ESP32. To do this, I wrote code that toggles between 3 stages when the user enters 's' from the keyboard. 

The first stage will turn an LED on/off when the user enters 't'.
The second stage will echo (print) what the user inputs. 
The third stage will accept a decimal integer from the user and print it in hexadecimal form. 


## Sketches and Photos
Here is a screenshot of the output from the console:
