## Summary
For this skill, I wired a servo to the ESP32 and added to the 'mcpwm_servo_control' example to run the servo through its full range. To do this, I set the minimum pulse width to 500, the maximum pulse width to 2550, and the maximum degree to 180. 

## Sketches and Photos
Here is a photo from the console:
