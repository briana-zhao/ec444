## Summary

I designed three FreeRTOS tasks using the ESP32, alphanumeric display, LEDs, and a button. In one task, the LEDs are used to count up and down in binary from 0 to 15. In another task, the direction of the counting is reversed when the button is pushed. This task implemented the button using a hardware interrupt. In the last task, 'UP' or 'DOWN' is displayed on the alphanumeric display depending on the direction of the counting. To do this, I added to the code I already had for skill 7 (GPIO) and skill 8 (Alphanumeric Display).
