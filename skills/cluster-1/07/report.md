## Summary

I used GPIO pins to control 4 LEDs. For this, I first built a circuit on breadboards consisting of the ESP32, 4 LEDs (red, yellow, green, and blue), and 4 resistors (330 Ohm). Then, I wrote code that displayed the binary numbers of 0 to 15 using the 4 LEDs. The code allows these numbers to continuously cycle from 0 to 15.


## Sketches and Photos
Here is an image of the completed ciruit:
