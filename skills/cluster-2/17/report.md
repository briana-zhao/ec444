## Summary

For this skill, I learned how to use CanvasJS. First, I picked two of the examples provided by CanvasJS and observed them on my computer. Then, I wrote a program that takes the data from the stocks-csv.txt file, parses the stock prices based on the company, and graphed them together on CanvasJs. 


## Sketches and Photos

Here is the first example I chose:

Here is the second example I chose:

Here is the graph I created from the stocks-csv.txt file:
