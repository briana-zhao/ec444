## Summary

For this skill, I first installed Node.js and NPM to my computer. I then completed the hello world tutorial, as well as the modules for Modules, HTTP, URL, NPM, and Events. Then, I used my skill for the IR Rangefinder to print sensor readings to the serial port. I wrote a node.js program to read from the serial port and print the sensor readings to the console. 


## Sketches and Photos

Here is a photo of the range sensor readings being printed to the console through the node.js program:
