## Summary

For this skill I represented the whack-a-mole game in a finite state machine (FSM) diagram and a state table. I then coded the FSM using the conditionals design pattern. The FSM has three states that the game switches between.


## Sketches and Photos

Here is a photo of my FSM diagram and state table:
